Build a Pure EA Forum Website (Step-by-Step)

You are tasked with building a professional forum website for Forex Expert Advisors (EAs), similar to EAHub or EABOOK, focusing solely on discussion threads, categories, user profiles, and engagement. Prioritize UI/UX first, then frontend, backend, SEO, and deployment.

Project Goals:

A modern, responsive, SEO-friendly forum where users can post questions, share strategies, and discuss Forex EAs (MT4/MT5).

User profiles with activity tracking, badges, and post history.

Categories and threads organized for easy navigation and SEO.

Secure, fast, and scalable platform for thousands of threads and users.

Tech Stack Recommendation:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Next.js API routes or Node.js/Express

Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

Search: Meilisearch (full-text forum search)

Auth: NextAuth.js (email + OAuth)

Hosting: Vercel + Supabase or Railway

SEO/Analytics: Google Search Console, GA4, structured data (JSON-LD)

Step-by-Step Roadmap

User profile page (posts, stats, badges)

Dashboard (optional: track activity, bookmarks)

Admin/moderator panel (thread moderation, user management)

Interactive prototype of all user flows.

Deliverable: Figma prototype + component library.

Phase 2 — Frontend Implementation (10–14 days)

Implement responsive UI in Next.js + Tailwind for all screens from Phase 1.

SEO-friendly URL structure:

/forum/[category] → category page

If you want, I can write a ready-to-use AI prompt next that you can paste directly into ChatGPT or any AI dev tool to generate the forum code step by step — including Prisma schema, Next.js pages, SEO setup, and UI components.
