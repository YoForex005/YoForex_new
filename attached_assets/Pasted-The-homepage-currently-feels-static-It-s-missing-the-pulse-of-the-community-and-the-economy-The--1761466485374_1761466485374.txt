The homepage currently feels static. It's missing the "pulse" of the community and the economy. The features from image_218ea1.png and image_218ebd.png solve this directly.

We will implement three new modules.

Initiative 1: The "What's Hot" Module (Content Discovery Engine)
This module answers the user's question: "What is the most valuable content on this site right now?"

Title: "What's Hot"

Location: Master Sidebar (Right Column).

Logic: This is a content leaderboard. It ranks posts (EAs, Indicators, Articles) based on a "hotness score" calculated from activity in the last 7 days (e.g., (views * 0.5) + (likes * 2) + (new comments * 3) + (new sales * 5)).

UI (per image_218ebd.png):

Numbered rank (1, 2, 3, 4...).

Content Title (linked).

Author, Star Rating, Views, Downloads/Sales.

Content Type Tag: A clear "EA," "INDICATOR," or "ARTICLE" tag.

Gold Coin Price: Must display the price (e.g., "ðŸ”¥ 750"). This is a critical Call to Action.

Hotness Score (e.g., "ðŸ“ˆ 98").

Initiative 2: The "Top Sellers" Module (Economic Engine)
This is our most important module for driving the Gold Coin economy. It creates superstars, builds trust in paid content, and directly incentivizes creators to upload high-quality, paid EAs.

Title: "Top Sellers"

Location: Master Sidebar (Right Column), next to or below "What's Hot."

Logic: This is an all-time sales leaderboard.

Query: SELECT post_id, COUNT(*) as sales_count FROM coin_transactions WHERE type = 'spend_content' GROUP BY post_id ORDER BY sales_count DESC LIMIT 5.

UI (per image_218ebd.png):

Numbered rank (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

Content Title (linked).

Author, Star Rating.

Gold Coin Price: (e.g., "ðŸ”¥ 500").

Total Sales Count: This is the key metric (e.g., "ðŸ“ˆ 1234 sales"). This provides the social proof.

Initiative 3: The "This Week's Highlights" Module (Community Engine)
This module makes the forum homepage (the main content feed) feel dynamic and alive. It shows users where the most important conversations are happening.

Title: "This Week's Highlights"

Location: Main Content Feed (Left Column), directly above the "Recent Discussions" feed.

Logic: This is a tabbed module to filter discussion threads.

UI (per image_218ea1.png):

"New" Tab (Default): Lists the 5-10 most recent discussion threads (identical to "Recent Discussions," so this can replace the top of that feed).

"Trending" Tab: Lists threads with the highest "hotness score" in the last 48 hours (e.g., (replies * 3) + (likes * 2)). This shows what's being debated right now.

"Solved" Tab: Lists the 5-10 most recent threads that have been marked with our "Solved" status. This highlights value and helpfulness.

List Item: Must show Category Tag, Thread Title, Author, basic stats (replies, views), and a clear "hotness" or reply count (e.g., "+23").

CTO's Directive:
These three modules are not "add-ons." They are the dashboard for our entire platform. "Highlights" drives discussion, "What's Hot" drives content discovery, and "Top Sellers" drives our economy.

Execute this. This is how we make the site addictive and profitable.
