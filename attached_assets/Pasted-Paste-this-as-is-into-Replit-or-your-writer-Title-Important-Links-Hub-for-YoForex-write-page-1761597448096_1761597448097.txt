Title: “Important Links Hub for YoForex — write pages + 1-line blurbs”

Goal
Expand the “Important Links” section and auto-generate short, human-friendly pages for each link. Keep language simple, encouraging, and practical. Avoid jargon. Make the copy feel like a helpful community guide (not corporate). Each page should help users get seen/ranked and stay safe.

Deliverables
	1.	A list of link cards (title + 1-line description) for the homepage/sidebar “Important Links”.
	2.	A separate page (300–600 words) for each link in clean Markdown (H1, short intro, bullets, numbered steps, mini-FAQ).
	3.	Use friendly headings, short paragraphs, and checklists.
	4.	Do not mention “SEO” too much—say “how to get seen/found” instead.

Page-specific guidance (key points to cover)

How to Earn Coins
	•	Earning basics: +10 new thread, +2 helpful reply, +1 upvote received, +15 accepted answer.
	•	Extra nudges: add timeframe/instrument/broker, attach set file/screenshot.
	•	Good examples of helpful replies (one-liners are fine; show 2–3).
	•	“No spam” reminder: low-effort posts don’t earn.

How to Get Your Thread Seen (avoid the word “SEO” where possible)
	•	Clear title formula: [Instrument] [Timeframe] – what you tried / what you need.
	•	Body must include: instrument, timeframe, broker, rules, results (if any), 1 question.
	•	Add 2–5 tags (chips): e.g., xauusd, m5, scalping, mt5, ic-markets.
	•	One sentence “summary” at top (we can prompt them in UI).
	•	Attach one clean screenshot if relevant.
	•	Link to 2–3 related threads (same instrument/timeframe).

How to Rank Your Articles/Blogs
	•	Natural headline (avoid shouting).
	•	First paragraph answers “who/what/when/result.”
	•	Use sub-headings for each idea; keep paragraphs short.
	•	Add a small checklist at the end: titles, summary, tags, links to 2–3 related posts.
	•	Friendly examples of strong vs weak titles (3 of each).

How to Rank EA Publications
	•	Title format: EA Name + version + platform + pair/timeframe.
	•	Include: what it does (1 line), requirements (account type, lot min, VPS?), tested pairs/timeframes, proof (equity curve or stats), known limits (e.g., news).
	•	3 screenshots: settings, chart example, results snippet.
	•	Add 5–8 tags (pair, timeframe, platform, strategy type).
	•	Be honest about risk; never claim guaranteed profit.

Report a Scam (Safely)
	•	Evidence list: dates, amounts, tickets, screenshots (mask account IDs).
	•	What to blur: account numbers, personal IDs.
	•	How to stay factual (no insults, just facts).
	•	Where to escalate (regulators, support channels).

Templates (Thread / Review / Journal)
	•	Provide copy-paste outlines with prompts like:
	•	Thread: “Pair + timeframe, your rules, what happened, what you want help with.”
	•	Review: “What you tested, where, for how long, pros/cons, 1–2 real metrics.”
	•	Journal: “Week number, pairs traded, wins/losses, changes for next week.”

⸻

Formatting & length
	•	Link card descriptions: max 14 words each.
	•	Guide pages: 300–600 words, scannable, use bullets.
	•	Use plain words like “get seen”, “show up,” “help others find your post.”
	•	Avoid heavy jargon; only use platform names, pairs, timeframes, and “tags.”

⸻

Output format
	•	Return a Markdown file per page (15 files) + one Markdown index that lists all link cards (title + 1 line) with relative links to each page.
