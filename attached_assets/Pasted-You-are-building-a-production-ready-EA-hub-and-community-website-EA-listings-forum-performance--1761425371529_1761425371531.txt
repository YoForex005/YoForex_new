You are building a production-ready EA hub and community website (EA listings + forum + performance reports) for Forex Expert Advisors. Prioritize **UI & UX first**, then implement backend, integrations, SEO, and deployment. Follow this step-by-step roadmap, deliverables, acceptance criteria, timeline estimates, and tech-stack decisions. Communicate weekly progress and provide demos after each milestone.

**Project summary & objective**

* Build a modern, SEO-friendly EA marketplace + forum where users can browse, upload, review, and discuss Forex EAs (MT4/MT5).
* Key goals: fast load times, excellent mobile UX, SEO-first architecture, secure file handling, and scalable infra.

**Primary tech stack (required)**

* Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (optional)
* Backend: Next.js API routes (edge/server actions) or Node.js/Express for heavy logic
* Database: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
* Search: Meilisearch (or Algolia)
* File storage: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2
* Auth: NextAuth.js (email + OAuth)
* Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase or Railway for DB
* Analytics / SEO: Google Search Console, GA4, structured data (JSON-LD)

### Final notes

* Prioritize **UI & prototype** first — this reduces rework and clarifies UX for backend APIs.
* Keep legal & DMCA workflows integrated early to avoid takedown/brand risk.
* Seed initial content and activate your 500 users during Phase 2–3 to create immediate indexing signals.

If you want, I can refine this into:

* a one-page brief for hiring contractors, or
* a Trello/Jira-ready task list with epics, user stories, and subtasks.
