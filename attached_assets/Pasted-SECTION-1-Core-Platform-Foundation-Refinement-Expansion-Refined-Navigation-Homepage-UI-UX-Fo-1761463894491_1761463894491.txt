Gold Coin Earning Mechanisms (Detailed)

A. Content Sales (User-to-User Marketplace)

Mechanism: Users can set a Gold Coin price (from 1 to 10,000) when publishing any EA, Indicator, or Article.

Transaction: Buyer pays coins, seller receives coins instantly.

Refund Policy: "All Gold Coin transactions are final. Please review content thoroughly before purchase."

B. Active Interaction Rewards (Gamified Engagement)

Posting a Comment: +2 Gold Coins (Max 10 coins/day/user; 1-minute cooldown per post).

Submitting a Review (on EA/Article): +5 Gold Coins (Min. 50 characters, approved by moderation, Max 2 reviews/day/user).

Marking a "Solution" on a Q&A Thread: The solution provider earns +20 Gold Coins (once per thread).

C. Passive Engagement Rewards (Time-on-Site)

Mechanism: For every 10 minutes of active browsing time, award the user +1 Gold Coin.

Active Tracking: Implement robust frontend tracking (mouse movement, scroll, key presses) and backend verification to distinguish active browsing from idle tabs. Capped at 60 coins per day (10 hours).

D. Official Bounties/Challenges:

Mechanism: Admin or selected users can post "Bounties" (e.g., "Fix this MQL4 bug for 500 Gold Coins"). First valid solution claims bounty.

Reward: Bounty creator pays specified Gold Coins to the solver.

E. Malicious Activity Reporting:

Mechanism: Users report spam, scams, or rule violations.

Reward: If the report is valid and the first, admin awards 1-100 Gold Coins (at admin's discretion).

Gold Coin Spending/Redemption Mechanisms

A. Purchasing Content: Primary use case. Users pay Gold Coins to download EAs, indicators, or view paid articles.

B. Accessing Premium Sections: Future: VIP forum access, beta program access.

C. Custom User Titles/Badges: Future: Spend 5000 Gold Coins for a "Legendary Trader" badge.

Gold Coin Top-Up System (Monetization)

Recharge Page: Clear UI with coin packs (e.g., 100GC=$10, 550GC=$50 + bonus, 1200GC=$100 + bonus).

Payment Gateway: Integrate CoinPayments API for USDT (TRC20/ERC20) and other crypto payments.

Workflow:

User selects pack.

System generates unique crypto address/QR code (via API) for the user to send USDT.

System monitors blockchain for payment.

Upon confirmed payment, user_wallet is updated.

Disclaimers (Critical): "Gold Coin top-ups are non-refundable. Gold Coins have no real-world cash value. YoForex.net is not responsible for external crypto wallet issues." (As per eabook.cn's policy.)

SECTION 3: AI-Enhanced & User-Driven SEO (Organic Growth Engine)
Every piece of user-generated content is a potential SEO asset.

"SEO Settings" Tab in Content Editor (for Users)

When a user creates/edits any post (EA, article, tutorial), they see an "SEO Settings" tab.

A. SEO Title (<title> tag):

Field: "Search Engine Title" (max 60-70 chars).

Default: Pre-fill with post title.

AI Suggestion: Offer 3 AI-generated alternative titles based on common SEO patterns (e.g., "Best [Strategy] EA for [Pair/TF]" or "[Problem] Solved: [Solution Name]").

B. Meta Description (<meta name="description"> tag):

Field: "Search Snippet Description" (max 155-160 chars).

Default: Pre-fill with first sentence of post.

AI Suggestion: Offer 3 AI-generated descriptions that are compelling and keyword-rich.

C. Focus Keywords (for content optimization):

Field: "Primary Keyword(s)" (comma-separated).

AI Assistant: As user types, suggest related keywords and show basic density/prominence in their post content (e.g., "Keyword 'Gold Scalper' appears 5 times. Good!").

D. Image Alt Text (CRITICAL for User-Driven SEO)

Directive: For every image upload within a user's post, the system MUST prompt the user for specific Alt Text.

Default: DO NOT use the user's post title. The default should be empty or use a generic "Image related to [Post Title]."

Prompt/Tooltip: "Describe this image for visually impaired users and search engines. E.g., 'Screenshot of Gold M15 backtest equity curve with 99% modeling quality.' This is important for SEO."

Requirement: Users must provide Alt Text or be given a clear warning about missed SEO opportunity.

E. Canonical URL Management:

Default: Auto-generate clean, SEO-friendly slugs (e.g., yoforex.net/ea/my-awesome-gold-scalper-v2).

Advanced (Admin/Pro Users): Option to set a custom canonical URL for external content if linking back to YoForex.net.

Automated Structured Data (Schema Markup)

Backend: Automatically implement JSON-LD Schema.org markup for every content type.

Product Schema: For EA/Indicator posts. Include name, image, description, sku (post ID), brand (user's name), offers (price=Gold Coin value, priceCurrency='GC', availability), aggregateRating (from user reviews).

Article Schema: For tutorials, guides, reviews. Include headline, image, datePublished, author, publisher, description.

Q&A Schema: For "EA Q&A" threads with accepted solutions.

Review Schema: For user-submitted reviews on EAs.

Internal Linking Optimization (AI-Powered)

"Related Posts" Widget: On every post page, dynamically suggest 3-5 contextually relevant other posts (EAs, articles) from YoForex.net, based on keywords, categories, and tags. This helps crawl depth and user engagement.

"Top Keywords" Cloud: In the sidebar or footer, display an automatically updated "Top Keywords" cloud linking to search results for those terms.

Sitemaps & Indexing

Dynamic Sitemaps: Generate XML sitemaps for all ea posts, article posts, and user profiles. Update daily.

Robots.txt: Configure robots.txt to guide crawlers efficiently.

SECTION 4: User Trust & Compliance
Clear Disclaimers:

Site-wide: Prominent "Trading involves risk. Never risk money you cannot afford to lose." disclaimer.

EA Posts: Every EA/Indicator post template must include: "Past performance is not indicative of future results. Use on demo first."

Gold Coins: "Gold Coins are virtual, non-refundable, and have no cash value outside YoForex.net."

Moderation Tools:

Admin Dashboard: Robust tools for reviewing reports, approving content, managing Gold Coin adjustments, and user bans.

Content Vetting: Especially for "Commercial Trials," implement an admin review process for posts (e.g., proof of performance required, strict formatting).

Broker Neutrality:

Clearly state YoForex.net is "broker-neutral."

Ban affiliate links for brokers in user posts unless explicitly part of an approved "Partnerships" section.

CTO's Final Directive:
This is our detailed blueprint. The key is execution. Prioritize the core Gold Coin economy (earning and spending via content sales), the USDT top-up, and the user-driven SEO tools.

Your Immediate Action Items:

Review this Master Prompt with the development and design teams. Ensure full understanding.

Prioritize the Gold Coin sales mechanism (user sets price, buyer pays, seller gets coins). This is the marketplace engine.

Confirm the USDT top-up integration with the payment gateway team.

Start designing the "SEO Settings" tab in the post editor with the specified fields (including Alt Text prompt).
