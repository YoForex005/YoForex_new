Building our platform's "immune system." We are implementing two major features: a structured Broker Directory (like WikiFX) and a community-driven Scam Watch.

This initiative is our #1 priority for building platform authority. It will be broken into two parallel developments.

Initiative 1: The "YoForex Broker Directory" (Structured Reviews)
This feature is a permanent asset, a new content vertical for the site. It requires its own database and pages.

1. Navigation & UI:

Add a new, top-level item in the main navigation bar: "Broker Reviews".

This link leads to a new "Broker Directory" homepage (not a forum page).

2. Database Schema:

Table brokers:

broker_id

name (e.g., "IC Markets")

slug (e.g., "ic-markets")

website_url

logo_url

admin_notes (e.g., "Regulated by ASIC, CySEC")

average_rating (Auto-calculated from reviews)

is_verified_by_us (Admin flag)

Table broker_reviews:

review_id

broker_id (links to brokers)

user_id (links to users)

rating (1-5 stars)

title

review_body (text)

is_scam_report (Boolean: 0 or 1)

date_posted

admin_approved (Boolean: 0 or 1)

3. Core Pages:

A) Directory Homepage:

Search Bar: "Find a Broker..."

Filters: "Top Rated," "Most Reviewed," "Scam Alerts."

CTA Button: "Submit Your Broker Review."

B) Broker Profile Page (e.g., yoforex.net/brokers/ic-markets):

Header: Broker Logo, Name, Website Link, average_rating.

Admin Info: Our admin_notes on their regulation.

Tabs:

"User Reviews": All reviews for this broker, sorted new-to-old.

"Scam Reports": Filters to show only reviews where is_scam_report = 1.

C) Submission Form:

User selects broker from a drop-down list (which searches the brokers table).

User provides 1-5 star rating.

User writes title and review_body.

Critical Checkbox: [ ] This is a SCAM REPORT.

Incentive: Display text: "Submit a quality review (200+ words) and earn +50 Gold Coins once approved."

Initiative 2: The "Community Scam Watch" (Flexible Reports)
This is for "scam telegram sellers" and other flexible reports. It's faster to implement because we can leverage our existing forum structure.

1. New Forum Category:

Action: Add a new card to our "Forum Categories" grid.

Title: Scam Watch & Alerts

Icon: A red shield (üõ°Ô∏è) or warning (‚ö†Ô∏è) icon.

Description: "Report scam Telegram sellers, fake EAs, or bad actors. Protect the community."

2. Custom Post Template:

Action: When a user clicks "New Thread" in this specific category, the text editor will be pre-filled with a template to guide them:

Markdown

**Scammer's Name / Handle:**
(e.g., Telegram @scam_user, Discord user#1234)

**What They Were Selling:**
(e.g., "A 'guaranteed profit' Gold EA," "A signals service")

**What Happened (Provide Proof):**
(Your story here. **You MUST upload screenshots** of the conversation, payment, etc. Reports without proof will be deleted.)

**Gold Coins / Money Lost:**
(e.g., "1500 Gold Coins," "$200 USDT")
3. Gold Coin Incentive (The Bounty):

Action: We will display this rule in the "Scam Watch" category description and as a pinned post.

Rule: "Protect the YoForex community. If you post a verified scam report with clear proof (screenshots, transaction IDs), an Admin will review it. If confirmed, you will be awarded +150 Gold Coins as a thank you."

Logic: This turns our users into a paid, decentralized moderation team. It's a powerful incentive.
