What’s inside (quick tour)

getCategoryTree_8.ts — your 8 main categories + subcats (exactly like your outline), with SEO metadata, coin rewards, and locales. Use it for nav, generateMetadata(), sitemaps, and the “Choose Category” dropdown.

middleware.geo.ts — detects country (Vercel/Cf headers) → maps to locale and redirects to /{locale}/…. It’s OFF by default; flip on later with GEOLOCALE_ENABLED=true. If a user picks a language manually, the prefLocale cookie wins (no bouncing).

seed_threads_60.(csv|jsonl) — 60 realistic forum threads spread across beginner questions, strategy chats, EA reviews, broker complaints, and success journals. Includes intentional typos/grammar quirks, mixed tones, and personal details so they index like real UGC.

seed_threads.js — tiny poster that reads the JSONL and calls your /api/threads (set API_BASE + API_TOKEN). Throttled, simple to tweak.

llms.txt — a clean starter policy for AI crawlers (allowed paths, disallowed private areas, attribution). Put in /public/llms.txt.

How to use fast

Categories: import getCategoryTree() into your Next.js app and:

render the home “Forum Categories” grid,

generate hreflang alternates from the locales array,

build category + subcat sitemaps from these nodes.

Seed content:

Set API_BASE=https://yourdomain and API_TOKEN=<your-admin-token>.

node seed_threads.js seed_threads_60.jsonl (or the CSV if your backend expects CSV).

You can re-run with a new JSONL to reach 150+ (I kept 60 here to keep things lean—you can duplicate or ask me to generate another pack).

IP→language:

Leave OFF for now (you said “later”). When ready: GEOLOCALE_ENABLED=true in env.

Make sure you have /{locale}/ routes or middleware will redirect to a missing path.

SEO & ranking for comments:

Give each reply a permalink page (/thread/[slug]/c/[replyId]) and include DiscussionForumPosting + nested Comment JSON-LD on the thread page.

Keep UGC links rel="ugc nofollow" unless trusted.

Ensure thread pages link to 3–5 related threads and the parent category (internal linking).
