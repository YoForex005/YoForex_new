1. High-Level Features Overview

The Gold Coin feature will be a reward system that allows users to earn coins based on their activity in the forum, particularly when they:

Contribute high-quality posts.

Share EAs with performance data.

Help other users by answering questions.

Participate in community-driven challenges or bounties.

Users can then redeem these coins for special benefits like:

Access to exclusive content or resources.

Custom titles or badges.

Enhanced privileges (posting in commercial sections, starting bounties, etc.).

2. Backend Development

The backend will manage the coin balance for each user and handle actions related to coin earning and redemption. Here’s how to structure the development:

a) Database Schema

You’ll need to add a coins table to your database to store user balances and transactions.

CREATE TABLE user_coins (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_coins INT DEFAULT 0,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE coin_transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    coin_amount INT,
    action_type ENUM('earned', 'redeemed', 'bought') NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

b) Coin Earning Logic

For earning coins, define the types of actions that users can perform to earn coins. Some examples:

Posting a thread or comment: +10 coins (valid only for "high-quality" posts, which can be validated by upvotes).

Uploading a verified EA: +50 coins for each verified EA shared with proof of performance.

Solving a technical support issue: +20 coins per accepted solution.

Bounties: Users who contribute solutions to active bounties earn coins based on the bounty size.

You can create a backend function to update the user’s coin balance each time an event occurs:

def earn_coins(user_id, coin_amount, action_type, description):
    # Add coins to user balance
    cursor.execute("""
        UPDATE user_coins
        SET total_coins = total_coins + %s, last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        WHERE user_id = %s
    """, (coin_amount, user_id))

    # Log the transaction
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO coin_transactions (user_id, coin_amount, action_type, description)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)
    """, (user_id, coin_amount, action_type, description))
    
    connection.commit()

c) Coin Redemption Logic

To allow users to redeem their coins, you can implement a redemption endpoint. The process will:

Check if the user has sufficient coins.

Deduct the coins from their balance.

Process the reward (access, badge, etc.).

def redeem_coins(user_id, coin_amount, reward):
    # Check if user has enough coins
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT total_coins FROM user_coins WHERE user_id = %s
    """, (user_id,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    if result and result['total_coins'] >= coin_amount:
        # Deduct coins
        cursor.execute("""
            UPDATE user_coins
            SET total_coins = total_coins - %s, last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            WHERE user_id = %s
        """, (coin_amount, user_id))

        # Log the redemption transaction
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO coin_transactions (user_id, coin_amount, action_type, description)
            VALUES (%s, %s, 'redeemed', 'Redeemed for reward: %s')
        """, (user_id, coin_amount, reward))
        
        # Process the reward (send access, issue badge, etc.)
        process_reward(user_id, reward)

        connection.commit()
        return True
    else:
        return False

d) Leaderboards and Badges

You will need to create a leaderboard for the users with the most coins earned. This will be a dynamic leaderboard that updates every time users earn or redeem coins.

def get_top_contributors():
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT user_id, total_coins FROM user_coins ORDER BY total_coins DESC LIMIT 10
    """)
    return cursor.fetchall()

3. Frontend Development (UI/UX)

The frontend will display users' coin balances, leaderboards, and allow users to redeem their coins. Below are some key components.

a) User Profile Page: Display Coin Balance and Redeem Button

You can add a Gold Coin Widget to user profiles to show the total coins they have, their current rank (based on coins), and an option to redeem coins for rewards.

<div class="profile-widget">
    <h3>{User's Name}</h3>
    <div class="coins">
        <p>Total Gold Coins: <span id="coins-count">{UserCoinBalance}</span></p>
        <button onclick="redeemCoins()">Redeem Coins</button>
    </div>
    <div class="leaderboard">
        <h4>Top Contributors</h4>
        <ul id="leaderboard">
            <!-- List of top contributors -->
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

.profile-widget {
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

.coins {
    background-color: gold;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

button {
    background-color: #000;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

b) Leaderboard Section:

The leaderboard can display the top users based on coin balance, motivating users to contribute more.

<div class="leaderboard">
    <h4>Top Contributors</h4>
    <ul id="leaderboard">
        <!-- Dynamically populated list of top users -->
    </ul>
</div>

c) Coin Redemption Modal:

A modal for users to redeem their coins and see available rewards.

<div id="redeem-modal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <h4>Redeem Your Coins</h4>
        <p>Total Coins: <span id="total-coins"></span></p>
        <select id="redeem-reward">
            <option value="premium-access">Premium EA Access - 100 coins</option>
            <option value="vip-group">VIP Group - 150 coins</option>
        </select>
        <button onclick="redeemReward()">Redeem</button>
    </div>
</div>

4. Coin Usage System

The coin rewards system should allow for dynamic reward creation:

Create a "store" where users can see what rewards they can claim for a certain amount of coins.

Allow admins to add, remove, or modify rewards easily from the backend (e.g., reward access to new EAs, or exclusive content).

Example:
Reward Store - Backend admin can configure:

{
  "rewards": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Premium EA Access",
      "coins_required": 100,
      "description": "Unlock access to exclusive EAs."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "VIP Group Access",
      "coins_required": 150,
      "description": "Join VIP discussion groups."
    }
  ]
}

5. Testing & Launch

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for:

Coin transactions (earn and redeem).

Leaderboard calculation.

Rewards redemption system.

Load Testing: Test with a large number of users earning and redeeming coins simultaneously to ensure no performance issues.

Beta Testing: Have a small group of users test the feature in a staging environment.

6. Future Enhancements

Real-Time Coin Updates: Use WebSockets to update coin balances in real-time across the platform.

Coin Boosters: Implement boosters that temporarily double the coins earned by users.

Referral Program: Reward users with coins for referring new users to the forum.
