Initiative 1: Layout Overhaul (The "Great Consolidation")
The current 3-column layout is cluttered. The hero image is for a blog, not a community. We are moving to a clean, modern 2-column layout.
Action: Remove the entire hero image/banner section from the forum homepage
Reason: It's distracting. The "Forum Categories" and "Recent Discussions" are the true homepage content.
nitiative 2: New Social Features (The "Community" Engine)
This initiative drives user-to-user engagement and retention.

1. "Follow" System:

Database: Create new table user_follows (follower_id, following_id).

UI:

Add a "Follow [Username]" button to all user profiles and user mini-profiles (by their post avatar).

Add "Followers" and "Following" tabs to the main User Profile page.

Logic: When a user is followed, their new posts trigger the Email Notification System.

2. Private Messaging (PM) System:

Database: Create messages table (sender_id, recipient_id, body, is_read, timestamp) and a conversations table.

UI:

Add a "Messages" (envelope) icon to the main site header.

Add a "Send Private Message" button to user profiles.

The "Messages" page will be a mini-inbox (Inbox, Sent, New Message).

3. Email Notification System:

Trigger: When a user (User A) creates a new post (a new thread, not a reply).

Action: The backend queries user_follows for all users following User A.

Job: For each follower, queue a plain-text email: "Hi [FollowerName], [UserA_Name] just posted a new thread: '[PostTitle]'. View it here: [Link]".

Mandatory Opt-Out: In User Settings, add a checkbox (default: on): "Notify me by email when a user I follow posts a new thread."

Initiative 3: The "Trust" Engine (Profile & Verification)
This is our most critical new feature. It's how we build authority and reward real traders.

1. New Profile Fields (in User Settings):

Create a new "My Profile & Verification" tab in the User Settings page.

Add the following fields:

YouTube URL (e.g., https://youtube.com/c/...)

Instagram Handle (e.g., @...)

Telegram Handle (e.g., @...)

Myfxbook Link (Must be a valid myfxbook.com URL).

Investor ID (Read-Only)

Investor Password (Read-Only)

Security Mandate: The Investor ID and Password fields MUST be encrypted in the database at all times. They are never displayed publicly. They are only for admin verification.

2. The "Verified Trader" System:

Flow: When a user submits an Investor ID/Password, it flags their account for admin review.

Admin Action: This is a manual process. An admin must log in (read-only) to verify the account is real.

Reward: If verified, the admin checks a is_verified_trader boolean in the users table.

Public UI: The user receives a "Verified Trader" badge next to their name on all posts and on their profile. This is the ultimate status symbol on our site.

3. Public Profile Display:

The public user profile will now display the YouTube, Instagram, and Myfxbook links (if filled out).

It will NEVER display the investor credentials.

Initiative 4: Upgraded Gamification (The "Incentive")
We must incentivize users to fill out these new fields. This is how we bootstrap the "Trust" system.

1. Gold Coin Rewards (One-Time Bonus):

In the User Settings page, display the reward next to the field:

Myfxbook Link: [_____] (Earn +100 Gold Coins)

YouTube URL: [_____] (Earn +25 Gold Coins)

Investor ID: [_____] (Submit for Verification & Earn +250 Gold Coins)

Logic: When the user saves their profile, the backend checks if the field was previously empty and is now filled. If so, award the coins and log the transaction (e.g., "One-time bonus for adding Myfxbook").

2. Reward Hierarchy:

Simple social links = Small reward (+25).

High-value links (Myfxbook) = Medium reward (+100).

High-trust data (Investor credentials) = High reward (+250).

The "Verified Trader" badge is the final, non-coin reward.

This prompt covers every request. It transforms the site from a simple forum into a full-featured, trust-based social community. Execute these initiatives in order.
