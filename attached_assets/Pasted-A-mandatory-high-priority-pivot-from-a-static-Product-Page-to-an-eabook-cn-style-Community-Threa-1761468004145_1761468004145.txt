A mandatory, high-priority pivot from a static "Product Page" to an eabook.cn-style "Community Thread" layout.

1. The Problem
Our current layout is wrong for a community-driven marketplace. It's an isolated sales page. It creates friction by hiding reviews and support behind tabs, killing all conversation and social proof.

2. The Solution
We will deconstruct this page and rebuild it as a single, full-width forum thread. The "Original Post" (OP) will contain all the product info, and the "Replies" will be the unified feed for all reviews, questions, and discussions.

3. Detailed Implementation Plan
Initiative 1: Deconstruct the Static Layout
Kill the 2-Column Layout: Remove the right-hand sidebar (the "Buy" box) entirely. The page will become a single, full-width content column.

Kill the Tabs: Remove the "Description," "Reviews (234)," and "Support" tabs. All this content will be merged into the new single-feed layout.

Initiative 2: Build the "Original Post" (OP) Block
This is the new "header" of the page. It will be a large, visually distinct block at the very top of the thread.

Container: Create a styled div (e.g., with a light background or border) that clearly contains all the original poster's content.

Content (from old "Description" tab):

The post's main image (the chart) goes at the top.

Post Title ("Gold Hedger EA 2025..."), Tags ("MT5", "XAUUSD"), and Stats (Views, Downloads) go directly under the image.

The "Overview," "Key Features," "Performance," and "What's Included" sections will be displayed in full, exactly as they are.

Author Info: The "About the Seller" box will be integrated inside this OP block, at the bottom.

"Buy Now" / Price Integration:

The "Buy" button must be central to this new layout.

We will add a "Purchase Bar" inside the OP block, right below the title/tags.

This bar will clearly show: "Gold Coins: 500" and a prominent "Purchase Now" button. This places the purchase action directly with the product.

Initiative 3: Implement the "Unified Reply Feed"
This is the most critical part. This feed will appear directly below the "Original Post" block.

Data Migration:

Action: Write a one-time migration script. All existing entries from the "Reviews" tab must be converted into standard "Comments" or "Replies."

Logic: These 234 reviews will become the first 234 posts in the new reply feed, retaining their original author and date.

New Reply System:

This will be our standard forum reply system.

Users can ask questions, leave new reviews, and (most importantly) post their own screenshots and results.

The "Author" (TraderJohn) can reply directly to user questions, and his replies should be highlighted (e.g., "Author" badge).

"Post Reply" Editor:

At the very bottom of the entire page (below all replies), the standard "Post a Reply" text editor will be shown, allowing new users to join the conversation.

4. Summary of the New User Flow
A user lands on the page.

They see the Original Post block, which contains all the product info, author info, and the "Purchase" button.

They scroll down immediately into the Unified Reply Feed.

They see old reviews, new questions from other users, and replies from the author.

This continuous, single-page experience allows them to see the product, the social proof, and the live support all in one place.
