Stats Bar
Four stats cards have equal visual weight, no priority​

"Today's Posts" and "Today's Members" labels are confusing/redundant​

No context explaining what these numbers mean to new users​

Left Sidebar - Critical Issues
"What's Hot" section shows "No trending threads yet" - empty state destroys trust​

"Link Coins" widget name is unclear (what does "Link" mean?)​

Coin balance (2,450) lacks context or explanation of value​

"New Thread" button in sidebar is redundant (should be in header)​

"Quick Actions" section takes up too much space with only 3 items​

"Forum Stats" shows redundant metrics already in top stats bar​

"This Week's Highlights" Section
Tab labels ("New", "Trending", "Solved") are unclear/vague​

All tabs show empty state with no threads​

Section occupies prime real estate but delivers zero value​

Tabs don't indicate what type of content they display​

Forum Categories
Category cards are slightly cramped with tight padding​

Thread/post stats are small and hard to scan quickly​

No visible hover states or interaction feedback​

Cards lack visual depth (flat appearance)​

Technical SEO Issues

Content & Trust Issues
Two major empty states ("What's Hot", "This Week's Highlights") kill credibility​
