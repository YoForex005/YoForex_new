Goal: Design and populate a modern, high-trust forum for algorithmic trading (MT4/MT5 EAs, indicators, strategies). Output production-ready UX copy, category descriptions, post templates, and 50+ seed thread titles.

Brand

Name: {Your Forum Name}

Tone: helpful, expert, zero hype, compliant

Audience: new→pro EA users, quants, MQL4/5 devs

Design System (deliver concrete UI copy + component specs)

Category Cards (grid, 2–3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile): title, 1-line description, icon, counters (threads, posts), last activity.

Thread List: badges (Solved, Guide, Code, Backtest, Set-file), mini-stats (views/replies), author chip, last reply time.

Post Composer with tabs: Write, Attach, Backtest, Set Files, Code.

“EA Card” component for uploads: hero image/logo, pair/timeframe tags, features list, risk label, version, changelog, links (demo/backtest/drive), Download CTA.

“Performance Report” component: equity screenshot, period, PF, DD, win-rate, model quality note, broker/account type, spread/VPS.

“How-To Template” & “Bug Report Template” blocks (auto-inserted when user picks a tag).

Right sidebar: Top Contributors, Trending EAs, Newest Set Files, Live Leaderboard, Quick Links (Rules, Safe Download, Broker/Account Guide).

Global features: tag filters (pair, TF, style, risk), code syntax highlighting (MQL4/5), versioned attachments, “Mark as Solved”, reactions, bookmark, follow thread, Bounty/悬赏 tag, Leaderboard/排名 page, Help/下载问题 sticky thread, multilingual toggle (EN/中文).

Category Architecture (merge best of global + CN communities)
Create short descriptions + example sub-tags for each:

Strategy Discussion — setups, market structure, execution discipline (tags: Trend, Range, Breakout, News, Grid, Martingale-free).

Beginner Questions — onboarding FAQs, glossary, safe broker/account basics.

Performance Reports — backtests, forward tests, equity curves, weekly/monthly journals.

Technical Support — installs, VPS, slippage, latency, symbol mapping, data quality.

EA Development (MQL4/5) — code help, architecture, optimization, portable patterns.

Success Stories — risk-aware wins, lessons learned.

EA Library (inspired by EAhub/EABOOK) — curated EA uploads with “EA Card” (sub-tags: Gold/XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, US30, BTCUSD/ETHUSD; TF: M1…H4). (Derived from the EA-focused menus on both sites. 
EAHub
)

Indicators Library — non-repaint vs utility indicators; strategy recipes. (From “指标/Indicators” sections. 
EAHub
)

Tools & Utilities — trade managers, panel UIs, optimizers, data tools (QuantAnalyzer, set-file managers). (Matches “工具/Tools”. 
EAHub
)

Source Code (EA/Indicator) — open-source drops, snippets, learning repos. (Reflects “外汇EA源码”. 
EABOOK
)

Learning Hub — step-by-step courses, checklists, booklets (mirrors “学院/外汇EA学习”). 
EAHub

Q&A / Help — rapid answers to install/download issues; sticky “Download Troubleshooting” thread at top. (Matches EABOOK’s download-issue help threads. 
EABOOK
)

Bounties (悬赏) — pay/points for code fixes, set-file tuning, research tasks. (From “悬赏”. 
EAHub
)

Rankings / Leaderboard (排名) — top EAs, top contributors, weekly movers (present on both communities).

Commercial Trials — broker-neutral area for vendor demos with strict proof/rules (parallels “商业外汇EA”). 
EABOOK

Seed Thread Titles (generate 6–10 per category)

Use practical, specific titles: “Best scalping settings for EURUSD M5 under RAW ECN (spread ≤ 3, LP depth?)”, “Gold M1: controlling slippage during CPI—real fills and VPS latency benchmarks”, “Share your set for XAUUSD H1 (target DD < 8%)”, etc.
