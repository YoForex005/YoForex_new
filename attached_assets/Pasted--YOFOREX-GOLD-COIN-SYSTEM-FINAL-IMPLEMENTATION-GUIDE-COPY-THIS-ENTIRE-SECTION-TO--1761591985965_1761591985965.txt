## **üí∏ SPENDING SYSTEM**

### **How Pricing Works:**

**DO NOT set fixed prices for content categories.** Let publishers decide their own prices for:
- EAs (Expert Advisors)
- Indicators
- Set files
- Articles and guides
- Source code
- Any other content

**Only Set Minimum Prices:**
- EAs: Minimum 20 coins
- Indicators: Minimum 10 coins
- Set files: Minimum 5 coins
- Articles: Minimum 10 coins
- Source code: Minimum 50 coins

Publishers can set any price above these minimums. Platform takes commission (20-25% depending on content type).

**Display Format:**
When showing content price, always display: "X coins ($Y.YY USD)"

Example: "500 coins ($27.50 USD)"

***

## **üîÑ WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM**

**Rules:**
- Minimum withdrawal: **1000 coins** = $55 USD
- Withdrawal fee: **5%** platform fee
- Available methods: Cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, USDT)
- Processing time: 1-3 business days
- User receives: 1000 coins - 5% = 950 coins worth = $52.25 USD

**Important:** Show clear calculation on withdrawal page:
"Withdrawing 1000 coins = $55.00 minus 5% fee ($2.75) = $52.25 you receive"

***

## **üéØ ECONOMIC BALANCE**

**Why These Lower Earning Amounts?**

The reduced free earning ensures:
- Coins have real value (not given away too freely)
- Users appreciate earned coins more
- Quality over quantity (encourages better contributions)
- Sustainable economy (supply doesn't exceed demand)
- Incentivizes purchases for users who want instant access
- Rewards consistent daily activity over long term

**Monthly Free Earning Potential:**
- Ultra-passive (login only): 180 coins ($9.90)
- Moderately active (login + 10 replies daily): 480 coins ($26.40)
- Very active (above + answers + reports): 700 coins ($38.50)
- Content sellers: Unlimited based on sales

This creates healthy balance where free users can participate but committed users either purchase or earn through quality contributions.

***

**END OF IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

This system makes earning possible but intentionally slow for passive activities, while rewarding quality content creation and sales. The affordable $5.50 entry point encourages purchases while maintaining coin value. Publishers control all content pricing, creating a free market.
